This repository is about my practical course on Fundamentals of Programming back to 2020. Here I collect some tasks that I did during the lab course and I also provide my own solutions for these tasks. There is some space for improvement of my coding and I cannot gurantee my solutions are 100% correct, but they passed all required tests that are provided by this course. Any suggestions or alternative solutions are highly welcome.
