### About this repo
This repository is about my practical course on Fundamentals of Programming back to 2020. Here I collect most of the tasks that I did during the lab course and I also provide my own solution code for these tasks. There is some space for improvement of my coding and I cannot gurantee my solutions are 100% correct, but they passed all required tests that are provided by this course. Any suggestions or alternative solutions are highly welcome. 

#### Task Description
All tasks are given in German language, because this course is in German.

#### Java
My solution was written with Java15 (this course was in 2020). IDE used is Intellij IDEA.

#### MiniJava
The MiniJava file in the solution are provided together with some of the tasks and we are required to use it in our solution for the tasks. MiniJava provides the following functions for:

##### reading integers (int):
* readInt(), prints on the console "Enter an integer:" and returns the read number
* read(), identical to readInt()
* readInt(String text), prints on the console the passed string and returns the read number
* read(String text), identical to readInt()

##### outputting strings to the console:

* write(String text) writes the passed string "text" with newline to the console. Thus this command is functionally identical to System.out.println(...)
* writeLineConsole(String text) is identical to write(String text)
* writeConsole(String text) writes only the passed string "text" to the console (Identical to System.out.print(...))

A line break can also be achieved by concatenating 'System.lineSeparator()'with the output text.
